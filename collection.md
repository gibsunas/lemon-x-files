## Improved Generic Type Representation in Gherkin

```gherkin
Feature: Generic Type System

  Background:
    Given the following generic type parameters are defined:
      | Parameter | Constraint    | Description                       |
      | T         | any           | Primary data type                 |
      | K         | keyof T       | Keys of type T                    |
      | E         | Error         | Error type extending Error class  |
      | R         | T extends S ? X : Y | Conditional type based on T |

  Scenario Template: Generic Collection Operations <operation>
    Given I have a collection of type "Array<T>"
    When I perform the "<operation>" operation
    Then I should receive a result of type "<resultType>"

    Examples:
      | operation | resultType | description                     |
      | map       | Array<U>   | Transform each item to type U   |
      | filter    | Array<T>   | Subset of original collection   |
      | reduce    | U          | Aggregated value of type U      |
      | find      | T?         | Optional item of type T         |

  Scenario: Using Generic Type with Constraints
    Given I have a generic function with signature "function extract<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K)"
    When I call the function with an object of type T and a key of type K
    Then I should receive a return value of type "T[K]"

```

### Back to ts

```gherkin
/**
* Generic collection operations
* @template T Primary data type
* @template U Result type for transformations
* @template K Keys of type T
*/

// Map operation: Transform each item to type U
function map<T, U>(collection: Array<T>, transformer: (item: T) => U): Array<U>;

// Filter operation: Create subset of original collection
function filter<T>(collection: Array<T>, predicate: (item: T) => boolean): Array<T>;

// Reduce operation: Aggregate to value of type U
function reduce<T, U>(collection: Array<T>, reducer: (accumulator: U, item: T) => U, initial: U): U;

// Find operation: Get optional item of type T
function find<T>(collection: Array<T>, predicate: (item: T) => boolean): T | undefined;

// Extract function with constrained generic types
function extract<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K];

```

## Type Constraints with Background
```gherkin
Background:
  Given the following type constraints are defined:
    | Type Parameter | Constraint                | Description                      |
    | T              | Record<string, any>       | Must have string-indexed fields  |
    | K              | keyof T                   | Must be a key of type T          |
    | V              | T extends infer U ? U : never | Inferred type from T        |
```

## Generic Type Relationships
```gherkin
Scenario: Modeling relationships between generic types
  Given I have generic types "T" and "U"
  When I define a mapping function between them
  Then the function should have the signature:
    """
    function transform<T, U>(
      input: T, 
      mapper: (value: T) => U
    ): U
    """

```
## Higher-Order Generic Types
```gherkin
Scenario: Working with higher-order generic types
  Given I have a "Container<T>" generic type
  When I need to transform the contained value
  Then I should use a function with signature:
    """
    function transformContainer<T, U>(
      container: Container<T>,
      transformer: (value: T) => U
    ): Container<U>
    """

```

## wildcards for unknown types

```gherkin
Scenario: Handling unknown type parameters
  Given I have a function that works with any type
  Then it should have the signature:
    """
    function process<*>(input: *): *
    """
  And the "*" should be replaced with appropriate type parameters in implementation

```



## upsides
Benefits of This Approach

### Type Parameter Documentation:

The Background section defines all generic parameters and their constraints
Each parameter can have a description explaining its purpose

### Relationship Modeling:

Clearly shows how different generic types relate to each other
Captures constraints between type parameters

### Parameterized Scenarios:

Scenario Templates allow testing the same behavior with different types
Examples tables can show different type combinations

### Conditional Types:

Can represent basic conditional type relationships
Shows type inference patterns


## downsides

Limitations That Remain
Despite these improvements, some TypeScript generic features remain challenging to represent:

### Complex Type Manipulations:

TypeScript's utility types like Partial<T>, Required<T>, etc. are difficult to express
Mapped and indexed access types need verbose descriptions

### Recursive Types:

Self-referential generic types are hard to represent clearly

### Variadic Generics:

TypeScript 4.0+ tuple types with spread operators don't have a natural Gherkin equivalent
The most effective approach is to use the Background section to establish the generic type system and then reference these types consistently throughout your scenarios. This creates a "type vocabulary" that can be used across the entire feature file.
